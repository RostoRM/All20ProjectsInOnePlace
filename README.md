# JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio

This is a course which I have taken from the ZeroToMastery academy. This course is called JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio.
It's greate course with good live project examples For those who not feel confident yet to master Javascript completely.
If you are interested in this course, you can find it [here](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects), also [here too](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

I am going to use this repo as a way to find all the projects in one place. If you are interested in any of those projects, you can find on README.md file in one place instead of searching through entire GitHub profile.

I have provided a source link to the repo on GitHub, which will have a basic description as well as all files projects needs. I also provided a live link which will take you to a live version of the project that you can try out.
